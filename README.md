This is an JAVA based android application.
In this app the user can get the weather details of any city in the world. And also the pressure , humidity , sunrise and sunset timings of that city .
I have use an API for fetching the above mentioned details . It is Weather API . I have used the concept of retrofit to establish a connection betwwen app and the API . 
Then for layouts I have used XML layouts. 
You can download the apk [here](https://github.com/saikrishna13032000/WeatherApp/blob/master/app-debug.apk)
